List of WiFi adpaters that are Plug n Play Raspberry Pi compatible (and some to avoid)

** Compatible
*Tested successfully using Raspberry Pi Zero W running Raspberry Pi OS (RetroPie / GamePi20 edition)*
- Panda PAU06
- Eastech RALINK RT5370

** NOT Compatible
- Alfa AWUS036ACS
 - I tried this card in several ways and couldn't get it to work.  In contrast, the Panda PAU06 and RALINK RT5370 are plug N play (instantly recognized, useable, and connect to WiFi).  Avoid this card
